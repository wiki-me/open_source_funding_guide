# A guide for funding open source - very WIP

# Introduction

The goal of this document is to help open source maintainers fund their project. It includes explanations of some marketing concepts, a list of case studies of open source projects that successfully achieved funding , useful websites for funding and other learning resources.

Keep in mind i am just some dude on the internet and have no formal training on the subject, Feel free to open an issue If you found a mistake or have feedback or a suggestion.

Positive feedback could also be useful, It could help validate that what i am doing is useful (And therefore motivate and help me to decide to prioritize working on this), Maybe i could set up a "testimonies" that will persuade people to read this stuff and give it a try, So if you read something and got good results from implementing it please post about it [here](https://github.com/wiki-me/open_source_funding_guide/issues/2).

# marketing basics

[heat
maps](https://onlygrowth.com/blogs/posts/how-to-use-heat-maps-and-eye-tracking-software-to-improve-ux-and-lift-conversion-rates)

how attention is measured using heat maps, and how to direct attention
to improve conversion rate.

[attention
span](https://www.towermarketing.net/blog/winning-the-fight-against-a-website-users-attention-span/)

basically how much time people pay attention to something, for web pages
it is reported to be 8 seconds (so it is best to try to make them
count).

for video it can be longer, so using videos can be a good way to show
the attractive qualities of a project.

[The reward system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system)

A system in the brain in charge of handling rewards, rewards can be
\"Primary rewards\" (which include things that are good for our or our
offspring survival, stuff like food or parental involvement).
\"Extrinsic rewards\" (like money or the good results of using a certain
feature of some software) are conditioned rewards and their ability to
motivates comes from being associated with Primary rewards (and can even
become pleasurable).

Reward anticipation is
